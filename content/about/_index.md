We are a part of the Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory located in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.  The research in our group is very broad, and we are interested in all aspects of machine learning.  Particular strengths of the group are in Bayesian approaches to modelling and inference in statistical applications.   The type of work we do can range from studying fundamental concepts in applied Bayesian statistics, all the way to getting our algorithms to perform competitively against the state-of-the-art in big-data applications.  We also work in a broad range of application domains, including neuroscience, bioinformatics, finance, social networks, and physics, just to name a few, and we actively seek to collaborate with other groups within the Department of Engineering, throughout the university as a whole, and with other groups within the UK and around the world.  If you are interested in finding out more about our research, please visit our Publications page, or visit the individual research pages of our group members.
