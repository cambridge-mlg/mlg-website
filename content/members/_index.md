### Carl Edward Rasmussen


I'm a professor in the Machine Learning Group and head of the Computational and Biological Learning Lab in the Division of Information Engineering at the Department of Engineering in Cambridge.

Research: I'm interested in the theory and practice of understanding and building systems that learn and make decisions. Humans have an exceptional ability to learn from experience, which sets them apart from current artificial intelligent (AI) systems. To understand human learning and design better AI we need principled approaches to learning and decision making based on Bayesian inference in machine learning. My interests span: probabilistic inference, reinforcement learning, approximate inference (variational and MCMC), decision making, non-parametric modeling, stochastic processes and efficient learning.

### Zoubin Ghahramani


Zoubin Ghahramani is Professor of Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge and Chief Scientist at Uber. He is also Deputy Director of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and a Fellow of St John's College. He was a founding Cambridge Director of the Alan Turing Institute, the UK‚Äôs national institute for data science. He has worked and studied at the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, the University of Toronto, the Gatsby Unit at University College London, and Carnegie Mellon University. His research focuses on probabilistic approaches to machine learning and artificial intelligence, and he has published over 250 research papers on these topics. He was co-founder of Geometric Intelligence (now Uber AI Labs) and advises a number of AI and machine learning companies. In 2015, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his contributions to machine learning.

### Jos√© Miguel Hern√°ndez-Lobato


Since Sep 2016, I am a University Lecturer (equivalent to US Assistant Professor) in Machine Learning at the Department of Engineering in the University of Cambridge, UK. I was before a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard Intelligent Probabilistic Systems group at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciencies of Harvard University, working with the group leader Prof. Ryan Adams. This position was funded through a post-doctoral fellowship given by the Rafael del Pino Foundation. Before that, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Machine Learning Group at the Department of Engineering in the University of Cambridge (UK) from June 2011 to August 2014, working with Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani. During my first two years in Cambridge I worked in a collaboration project with the Indian multinational company Infosys Technologies. I also spent two weeks giving lectures on Bayesian Machine Learning at Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic). From December 2010 to May 2011, I was a teaching assistant at the Computer Science Department in Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (Spain), where I completed my Ph.D. and M.Phil. in Computer Science in December 2010 and June 2007, respectively. I also obtained a B.Sc. in Computer Science from this institution in June 2004, with a special prize to the best academic record on graduation. My research revolves around model based machine learning with a focus on probabilistic learning techniques and with a particular interest on Bayesian optimization, matrix factorization methods, copulas, Gaussian processes and sparse linear models. A general feature of my work is also an emphasis on fast methods for approximate Bayesian inference that scale to large datasets. The results of my research have been published at top machine learning journals (Journal of Machine Learning Research) and conferences (NIPS and ICML).

### Tameem Adel

I am a research fellow in the Machine Learning Group at University of Cambridge, working with Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani and with Dr. Rich Turner. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLAB), advised by Prof. Max Welling. I have obtained my PhD from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada in 2014.

My main research interests are circulated around probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), Bayesian inference and learning, interpretability and fairness of ML models, (deep) generative models, learning with weak supervision, especially transfer learning and domain adaptation, deep learning, reinforcement learning, continual learning, meta-learning and medical (especially MRI) applications of ML.

### Wessel Bruinsma

Hey, üëãüèº! My name is Wessel.
I am a PhD student at the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner), and a member of Christ's College.
Previously, I was a machine learning researcher for [Invenia Labs](https://invenialabs.co.uk); they solve problems in the fields of machine learning, finance, electricity systems and markets, and complex systems.
Even before that, I was an electrical engineer for the [TU Delft Solar Boat Team](http://www.solarboatteam.nl/). 

I hold an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](http://www.mlsalt.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/bachelors/ee/bachelor-of-electrical-engineering/) from the University of Delft.
My personal website can be found [here](https://wesselb.github.io/).

My research interests include probabilistic modelling with a focus on Gaussian processes and approximate inference.

### Andrew Y. K. Foong

I'm a PhD student supervised by [Professor Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner), and a member of Trinity Hall. 
I work primarily on probabilistic modelling and deep learning. 
My work to date has focused on understanding the effects of approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks, and on incorporating convolutional architectures into Neural Processes, which are used for meta-learning. 
I started my PhD in 2018, and prior to that I obtained my BA and MEng in Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge.
I tweet occasionally about my research [here](https://twitter.com/AndrewFoongYK).

### Austin Tripp

I'm a PhD student (2019 start) supervised by Professor Hern√°ndez-Lobato, and
a member of Girton College. My main research interest is creating machine
learning methods for unique problems in the natural sciences, particularly
chemistry. During my PhD I've been focusing on using generative models for drug
discovery. Prior to studying at Cambridge I earned a BASc in [nanotechnology
engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/nanotechnology/) from the [University of
Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in Canada. More information can be found on my
[personal website](austintripp.ca).
